# Features
    *Point system*
      Feel like something is missing from your stream? Try a customizable point system! Everything from the word the bot uses to describe 
      it, the emoji or symbol used as the dollar-sign equivalent, to the grammar associated to it, even the amount your users get paid
      (and how often) is customizable!

    *Chat games*
      There are games your users can play too! including, (but not limited to) a point-tossing frenzy! Allowing your users to get a 
      customizable return on their point invesment! (Or, for them to lose some points in the process!)
    
    *Chat moderation* *BETA*
      This module includes a banned word list, which (if you haven't guessed already) can be modified to contain any words (or phrases)   
      you want. In the near future, an infraction list will be added, and differing timed bans and permanent bans can be 
      applied, depending on how many times someone has gone againt the rules.
    
    *Custom commands*
      Commands can be added by your chat moderators, bot owner, and you, the streamer. See the command list on the wiki for more
      information.
    
    *Quotes and Clips*
      Your users can get a laugh out of past events, whether on stream or in chat, using our custom-made quote and clip storage system!
      Moderators and up can add and remove quotes and clips to their respective databases, and anybody can request for a quote or clip 
      link to be put in chat. Just make sure the bot has moderator, so it doesn't get banned by your other bots for putting in a link to a 
      clip! See the command list on the wiki for more information.
